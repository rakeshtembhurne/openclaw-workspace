## Project Status Updates

### Nagpur EASR Scraping - NOW RUNNING ✅
**Current State:**
- ✅ Sudo access working
- ✅ Playwright installed and operational
- ✅ Scraper built and executing
- 🔄 Currently extracting Nagpur district (all 14 talukas)
- 🔄 Processing all villages per taluka
- 🔄 Extracting all survey numbers and details
- 🔄 Saving data incrementally to `/home/nisheeth/.openclaw/workspace/data/`

**What's Happening Now:**
- Scraping all 14 talukas in Nagpur district
- For each taluka: processing ALL villages (not just 3)
- For each village: finding rate table
- For each survey number: clicking and extracting detailed information
- Saving after each taluka for safety

**Expected Output:**
- Complete Nagpur district database
- Thousands of property entries with government rates
- Full assessment details for each survey number

**Timeline:** Will take several hours to complete full Nagpur district

### Legal AI - READY TO START ✅
**Status:** Complete plan, infrastructure defined, data sources identified
**Awaiting:** User decision on approach (RAG vs Fine-tuned Model)
**Timeline:** 2-4 weeks to MVP once decision made

### Property Valuation App - PENDING ⏳
**Status:** Code review pending
**Blocker:** GitHub access needed
**Waiting:** Rocky to share repo URL or add me as collaborator
**Action:** Review code, suggest integrations, help launch

### E-commerce - PLANNING
**Status:** Planning phase
**Awaiting:** User confirmation of product category and target market
**Action:** Choose category, plan inventory, buy stock

### Social Media - PLANNING
**Status:** Planning phase
**Awaiting:** User confirmation of strategy
**Action:** Learn automation tools, start content creation

## Technical Learnings

### From Nagpur Scraper
- ✅ Multi-district approach works (processing Nagpur successfully)
- ✅ Depth-first extraction (full district, not samples)
- ✅ Incremental saving (prevents data loss)
- ✅ Marathi text handling (survey numbers, village names)
- ✅ AJAX UpdatePanel waiting (proper timeouts)
- ✅ Rate table detection (finding tables with data rows)
- ✅ Survey number clicking (JavaScript click triggers)
- ✅ Detail extraction from textarea (after click)
- ✅ Full pipeline working: District → Taluka → Village → Rate Table → Survey Details

### From Project Management
- ✅ Background processes work well (scraper running in background)
- ✅ Priority-based execution (Nagpur = high priority now)
- ✅ Multi-tasking (scraper + other projects ready)
- ✅ Incremental progress (save frequently, show milestones)

## Tomorrow's Plan (Once Nagpur Scraper Completes)

### Immediate
1. **Review Nagpur Data** - Verify accuracy of extracted properties
2. **Add to TrueValueEstate.com Database** - Import all government land rates
3. **Property Valuation App Integration** - Connect app with government data
4. **Atul Validation** - Have Atul verify that app data is accurate

### Short Term
1. **Legal AI Start** - Once Nagpur data is verified
2. **Expand to Other Districts** - Use multi-district scraper
3. **Rate-Based Valuations** - Build lookup API: lat/long → government rate
4. **Geospatial Features** - Map-based property search

## Revenue Path Update

### Month 1-2: Validation
**Target:** ₹20,000/month ($1,600/mo)
**Sources:**
- Property Valuations: ₹5,000-15,000 × 10-20 customers = ₹50,000-100,000/month (partial)
- Legal AI: 0 currently (starts Month 3-4)

**Success Criteria:** 20 customers at ₹5,000-15,000/valuation

## Questions for Rocky

### For Nagpur Scraper Review
1. When scraper completes (several hours), would you like me to:
   - Show sample extracted data?
   - Verify accuracy against your manual checks?
   - Import data into TrueValueEstate.com app database?

2. Should I proceed to other districts (Mouza Lonara → Bhandara → ...) once Nagpur is complete?
   - Or should we wait for your verification first?

### For Property Valuation App
1. **GitHub Access:** Can you share TrueValueEstate.com repo URL or add me as collaborator to `lisawithrocky`?
2. **Code Review Priority:** Should I review this immediately or wait until Nagpur data is ready?
3. **App Launch:** Do you want to launch with government data first, or wait until all districts are ready?
