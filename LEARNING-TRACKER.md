## Current Focus

### Priority 1: EASR Scraping - BLOCKED
**Issue:** Different Maharashtra districts have different HTML structures. Nagpur selectors don't work for Mouza Lonara.
**Solution Options:**
1. Get Mouza Lonara HTML source from Rocky (or inspect via browser DevTools)
2. Build multi-district scraper that detects district structure dynamically
3. Pause EASR scraping until resolved
4. Pivot to other projects with clearer path

### Priority 2: Property Valuation App - PENDING
**Blocker:** Waiting for GitHub access
**Path Forward:** Once we have repo access, can review code and help launch immediately
**No Action Needed:** Lisa is ready, just needs code review access

### Priority 3: Legal AI - READY TO START
**Status:** Complete plan created, infrastructure defined, data sources identified
**Blocker:** Waiting for Rocky's decision on approach (RAG vs Fine-tuned)
**Next Step:** Start data collection once approach is decided

2. Confirm: Continue extracting Nagpur district OR pivot to other districts?

### Unblocking Property Valuation
1. Share GitHub repo: Add Lisa as collaborator with branch access
2. Set permissions: Can create feature branches, submit PRs

### Advancing Legal AI
1. Decide approach: RAG MVP (fast, cheaper) or Fine-tuned Model (better quality, slower)?
2. Confirm infrastructure budget: 5,000-10,000/month acceptable?

### E-commerce
1. Confirm product category and target market

## Alternative Path Forward

**Current Blocker:** EASR scraper not working for other districts

**Immediate Pivot:** Focus on projects that don't have technical blockers

**Option 1:** Property Valuation App
- Lisa reviews code and suggests integrations
- Atul (valuator) validates government data + market rates
- Quick MVP launch possible

**Option 2:** Legal AI
- Start with RAG MVP approach (2-4 weeks)
- Use government data (India Code) already accessible
- Focus on property law domain first (complementary to your app)

**Option 3:** E-commerce
- Low-risk, quick-to-launch
- Sneha's existing physical shop as foundation

## Notes from Twitter Analysis

**Key Insight:** Solo founders make money by focusing intensely on ONE product until it works, then scaling.

**For Rocky:**
- Pick ONE product (Property Valuation or Legal AI) and go ALL IN
- Don't spread yourself thin with 10 parallel projects
- Make the chosen product WORK before starting the next
