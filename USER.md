*Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.*

- **Name:** Rocky
- **What to call them:** Rocky
- **Pronouns:** *(optional)*
- **Timezone:** Asia/Kolkata
- **Notes:** Self-taught programmer, 15 years experience. Poor background, no financial help before. Good at learning, recognizing patterns, and seeing where trends will go. Left job recently to go all-in on AI ventures full-time. Weakness: managing people, marketing, operations — focused too much on coding. Needs someone to execute 24/7 while he orchestrates and plans. Goal: first million dollars in 3-6 months.

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
