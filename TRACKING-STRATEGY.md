# TRACKING-STRATEGY.md - How We'll Actually Track AI Trends

*Direct scraping of X/Twitter is blocked. Here's the backup plan.*

---

## The Problem
- X/Twitter blocks direct access (requires login, 2FA)
- Nitter instances are unreliable
- Google Search blocks automated scraping
- Most platforms have anti-bot protections

---

## Workaround Solutions

### 1. Manual Curation (Best for Now)
**Rocky shares notable posts/screenshots**
- When you see something valuable (revenue numbers, new tool, business model), forward it to me
- I'll organize and extract insights
- Less noise, more signal

### 2. Monitor Alternative Platforms
Many of these creators are active elsewhere:
- **YouTube:** @levelsio, @bentossell, @aisolopreneur have channels
- **Newsletters:** Ben's Bites, others
- **Blogs:** pieterlevels.com, personal sites
- **Product Hunt:** Look for launches from these creators

### 3. RSS Feeds (If Available)
Some creators have RSS feeds for their blogs/newsletters

### 4. Set Up Alerts
When the GitHub access is sorted, we can build a simple scraper that:
- Uses Twitter API with a free tier account
- Runs periodically to save posts to files
- Focuses on keywords: "MRR", "ARR", "launch", "revenue", "$"

## For Now: Share the Good Stuff

Instead of me scrolling through 100 accounts:
1. **You forward posts** that look valuable
2. **I extract patterns** and update `AI-TRENDS.md`
3. **We build the database** over time

This is actually more efficient — less noise, more signal.
